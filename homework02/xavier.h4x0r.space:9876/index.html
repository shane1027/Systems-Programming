| If you seek the ORACLE, you must come  |
| back and _request_ the DOORMAN at      |
| /{NETID}/{PASSCODE}!                   |
|                                        |
| To retrieve your PASSCODE you must     |
| first _find_ your LOCKBOX which is     |
| located somewhere in                   |
| ~pbui/pub/oracle/lockboxes.            |
|                                        |
| Once the LOCKBOX has been located, you |
| must use your hacking skills to        |
| _bruteforce_ the LOCKBOX program until |
| it reveals the passcode!               |
|                                        |
\ Good luck!                             /
