## Question 1

1. I do not have a PUBLIC or PRIVATE folder on the AFS drive.  When I created them myself they received the same ACL as my home directory, which is:


* Normal Rights

    * nd_campus l

    * system:administrators rlidwka

    * system:authuser l

    * sryan8 rlidwka


a,) I cannot answer since I do not have these directories.

b.) My best guess is that the Public directory has read and write permissions for any user and the Private directory has read write and execute only for the owner and root.


## Question 2

a.) The result of the command was information from touch saying that my Permission was denied.  No, I was not able to create said file.

b.)
