New commands encountered (or covered in further detail)


du - used to estimate file space usage

    ls -l can also list properties of a file, but isn't useful when performed  
    on a symbolic link.

chmod - change the permissions on a file (covered more in depth)

using the >> means 'append to a file'.  For example:
    
    touch abc
    (write a word in abc)
    echo hello >> abc
    cat abc
   >hello
   >hello
