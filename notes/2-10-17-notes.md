#### More on sed:

Can capture matches and reference them later:

Ex: `cat /etc/passwd | sed -En 's|.*:(.*[uU]ser[^:]*):.|\1|p'`

    `.*:`   <--- match anything up until `:` which is our delimiter

    `(.*[uU]ser[^:]*):`     <--- match anything w/ word user until next `:`, and
    capture the phrase

    `.|\1`      <--- Then match anything for the rest of the expression and
    replace the whole line (which is the whole match) with the captured phrase


Also, can perform multiple search and replace commands on one line:

Ex: `echo "    charles loves to sing    " | sed -E -e 's|^[ \t]*||' -e 's|[ \t]*$||' | cat -A`
