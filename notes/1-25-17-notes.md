Notes from Wednesday's class:



Warmup Questions:

**What is unix?**
    A family of operating systems based on a central idea / framework.

**What is a Shell?**
    A program used to interact with your operating system - typically an
        interactive command prompt.

**What is Git?**
    A version control system used to organize code over time, maintain various
        versions, and collaborate from a central location on a server.




Today's Main Questions:
-----------------------

##### 1. Where is 'ls' located?

##### 2. How large is my `/.cshrc?`

##### 3. How do I prevent people from reading my work?

##### 4. How do I create a shortcut to my course dropbox?

##### 5. Where did I put that cpp file?




Now let's talk about filesystems (located on your hard drive)
    
    - organized in a hierarchy
        - root
            - parent
                - child
                - child
            - parent
                -child

                etc.

    ex:     / _ afs - network affiliated file system (lives on a network drive)
                bin -  binary executables
                etc -  configs
                var - application data
                lib - libraries
                tmp - scratch space (anyone can write to this dir)
                usr - user binaries (programs needed for OS to function)

            [note: this is volatile - may be deleted upon reboot (inram)]
                /var/tmp is non-volatile and open to anyone.

    A hard drive will likely be divided into partitions (my arch installation 
        has 4 partitions - boot (fat32), root (ext4), swap (swap), home (ext4)



    Relative path:  include ../../something as a reference to some current path
    Absolute path:  relative to the root directory (i.e. /bin/usr/)


Answer to question 1:

    The $PATH variable (environment variable) holds directories in which your
    computer searches for a command (i.e. asks each dir if they have ls)
        Add a directory to your path variable to always have it available @cmd 
        

Answer to question 3:

    File Permissions:
        
        Files have associated flags:  read, write, execute (r w x)
    
        A file has different permissions for the user, , and others.

        We represent the three flags combined in octal since there are 8 comb.

   user     r w x
            1 1 0  --> 6

            r w x
            1 0 0  --> 4

   others   r w x
            1 0 0  --> 4

            change permissions using chmod command


Softlinks are files that contain a location of where to reference (like a ptr)












    TO DO: 
    
    - read more about inode data structures, which hold all file
        information other than name and the file's actual data.

    - changing a name of a file in the system doesn't actually move any data,
        it simply modifies the inode!

    - draw out hierarchy of file data on board
