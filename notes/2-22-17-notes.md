## Python Stuff

###Tour of Python

#### Data Structures

- Lists
- Dictionaries

    - 

- Sets
- Tuples

#### Command Line Args

- sys.argv

    - this is like $@ from bash - access command arguments

#### I/O

- sys.stdin

    - can be treated as an object, useful for importing multiple lines of input

- input

    - gonna need to lookup stuff on that from mondays lecture

- Read a file
- Write a file

    filehandle = open('name', 'w')  # open for writing
    filehandle.write(something)
    filehandle.close()

    Note:  need to close files so that we dont run out of file descriptors!
        explore with `ulimit -a`

        However, unlike C/C++, Python has garbage collection, which removes
        resources that are no longer in use.  Nice..

        Look into linked lists and new / delete in C++

        Also, a `with` statement will close the file:
        '''with open('text.txt', 'w') as output:
            output.write(result)'''

#### Regular Expressions

- re.findall

#### Processes

- os.system

    - interact with system commands
- os.popen

#### Requests

- check out the GITLAB EXAMPLE REPO for this class!!!
