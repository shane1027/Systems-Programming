Went over usage of 'find':

    ex. find ~ -name '*.cpp'

        Finds all .cpp files within the home directory and below.

    How about running a command on each file that is a match?

        find ~ -name '*.cpp' -exec stat {} \;

   Note that this starts an individual process for each file found!

   Instead, we could see the same results (much faster too) w/ | xargs stat
