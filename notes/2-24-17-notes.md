## Similarities Between Python and C++

Python          C++
------

List            Vector      (Dynamic)

Dictionary      Map         (Associative)

Tuple           Array       (Fixed)


We are switching from shell scripting to Python in order to use a more complete
programming language with *data structures*.



For example:  Let's make a spell checking tool.

In linux, /usr/bin/ has a long list of valid words

Check out spellcheck.py




Whoa!! our spellchecking program ran for minutes on end checking a list, but
only for a half second using a dictionary..... #hashtables


Also, JSON powers the internet... dictionaries passed back and forth.

Don't use regular expressions to chop up JSON!  address keys and values!
